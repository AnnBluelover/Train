# Training project

The project aims to develop coding skills with several small tasks.

#### Prerequisites

1. The code was written and tested with `python3.5`.

2. In `group.py`,we achieve two goals, encrypting and grouping images. We grouping image data into several groups and encrypting images.

### Data Preparation

The data organized by the format below:
	`name_1.xxx`
	`name_2.xxx`

`xxx` means the formats like(`'jpg', 'png', 'bmp', 'jpeg','crp'`)

### Results

The paths of image data should be provided according to your own need. You can change it in `fileDir` and `saveDir`. After running the program `.crp`  files can be obtain and files saved in groups under the `saveDir`
